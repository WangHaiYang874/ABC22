1. where is the canonical place to put my texts. Maybe I should just have a function that prints out the text after each plot. Or I can input the texts into the model class...
   1. more information in plots (MCMC run length, among others).
2. do one of warne's experiement. this requires a frame work of **rejections** and everything. 
   1. have more than one kind of atom (not just H and H2) and measure the copy number of just some of the species.
3. affine inv with 2 pts moving at the same time. 

## optimization works
1. I should clean up my codes in `BayesianModel.py` and `models.py`, there are a few terms that should be simplified. And `models.py` should be a sub-class of `BayesianModel.py`.

1. canonical way to find the mode of samples from continuous r.v. 
   the mpe
2. affine inv with multiple points moving. 
3. population mcmc and etc.
