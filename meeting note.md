optimal coupling theory
- Wasserstein distance:
  - if you have two probability distribution, find a joint distribution that minimize the distance. 
- Kantorovich Rubenstein
- Monge

Better than the usual l1 norm of pdf. this gives a better distance. 


exercise: prove th CLT via coupling. 

- what problems are our algo practical to? 
- compare to what other methods. ABC? 
- just try some vanilla problems. 



## TODOs

- [ ] coupling prove on the CLT
  - [ ] steins method
  - [ ] fourier method
  - [ ] discovered by goodman, but he is probably not the first one. 
  - [ ] if this is really new, you can publish as a note. 
- [ ] finish coupling of tau-leaping to gilespie. 
- [ ] non-ABC problem. simulating the unobserved times. ABC refers to the ABC chemical problems. bridge move. 
- [ ]
