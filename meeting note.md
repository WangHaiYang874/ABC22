optimal coupling theory
- Wasserstein distance:
  - if you have two probability distribution, find a joint distribution that minimize the distance. 
- Kantorovich Rubenstein
- Monge

Better than the usual l1 norm of pdf. this gives a better distance. 




- what problems are our algo practical to? 
- compare to what other methods. ABC? 
- just try some vanilla problems. 



## TODOs

- [x] coupling prove on the CLT. failed attempt ‚ùå. 
- [ ] finish coupling of tau-leaping to gilespie. 
- [ ] non-ABC problem. simulating the unobserved times. ABC refers to the ABC chemical problems. bridge move.
